# Android-Linux-Bluetooth-Communication
This repository details the steps to open a RFID communication channel on an Ubuntu PC and receive data from an Android app through Bluetooth.

As I haven't found many complete tutorials that aid with the understanding of how to open communication channels for Bluetooth communication between a Linux PC with an Android app, I decided to summarise the set of steps/commands that would help get anyone up and running easily.
